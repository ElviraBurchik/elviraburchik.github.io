Previously, I worked atÂ **<a href="https://flo.health/" target="_blank" style="color:#4CA3DD">Flo Health</a>** - the number one women's health app in both the Android and Apple app stores with 100 million installs and 30 million monthly active users.<br /><br />
At **<a href="https://flo.health/" target="_blank" style="color:#4CA3DD">Flo Health</a>**, I grew up as a person and a professional, made some good friends, and tried myself in lots of opportunities when finally decided to move on to the next big thing ðŸš€
